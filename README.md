### Education

I have gained all my knowedge thanks to the program called IT-kariara powered by SoftUni.

- IT-kariera is a three year-long national program, consisting of 12 modules and one final matriculation exam.

- During education, I was taught the programming essentials, object-oriented programming, data bases, algorithms, embedded and operating systems, functional programming, internet programming and general software development.

- I mainly worked with .NET Framework Console Applications, ASP.NET Core Applications and MySQL but also TinkerCad (C++) and Haskell.

- The program was powered by the Technology School Electronic Systems (TUES), Software University (SoftUni) and the Ministry of Education.

- During a two week internship at the company Haemimont , I worked on a demo REST API about giving specific shape files with longitude, latitude and colors to a map and visualising it. I learned the main concepts of the database PostgreSQL and the platform QGIS, Postman, DBeaver. My main contributions were at the back-end side with the language C# and the technology ASP.Net.Core.
