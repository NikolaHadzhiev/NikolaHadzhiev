### C# Skills

I have gained all my knowedge thanks to the program called IT-career powered by SoftUni.

- IT-career is a three year-long national program, consisting of 12 modules and one final matriculation exam.

- During education, I was taught the programming essentials, object-oriented programming, data bases, algorithms, embedded and operating systems, functional programming, internet programming and general software development.

- I mainly worked with .NET Framework Console Applications, ASP.NET Core Applications and MySQL but also TinkerCad (C++) and Haskell.

- The program was powered by the Technology School Electronic Systems (TUES), Software University (SoftUni) and the Ministry of Education.

- During a two week internship at the company Haemimont , I worked on a demo REST API about giving specific shape files with longitude, latitude and colors to a map and visualising it. I learned the main concepts of the database PostgreSQL and the platform QGIS, Postman, DBeaver. My main contributions were at the back-end side with the language C# and the technology ASP.Net.Core.

- In present day I still use and master C#, mainly in REST APIs - latest project: https://github.com/NikolaHadzhiev/TechHeaven-Ecommerce/tree/main/API

### JavaScript Skills

Personally, I love developing front-end applications with ReactJS because it offers a powerful and efficient way to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces, enabling a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
SoftUni is the university that gave me knowledge about software development, equipping me with the skills and expertise needed for a successful career in the tech industry.

- During JS Web Developer Modules, I was taught to develop data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.
- The modules provided knowledge and practical skills for the development of Single Page Applications (SPA) using ReactJS technology,custom hooks, Context API and SaSS
- Driven by my ambition to learn and grow, I took the initiative to self-teach and master the intricacies of ReactJS coupled with Redux Toolkit, a decision that has not only enhanced my skill set but has also empowered me to create sophisticated and efficient web applications.
