### ‚öõÔ∏è Greetings everyone, I'm Nikola! ‚öõÔ∏è

## I'm studing to become a professional Software Engineer

- üå± In my free time I am always googling and learning new stuff about programming.
- üëØ I like to participate in teamwork projects, but I also enjoy to write code on my own.
- <img align="left" alt="goal" width="22px" src="./images/javascript.svg" /> Extremely keen on mastering JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js
- Projects I have participated in: https://github.com/GNA-projects
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I am very beneficial when we talk about self-study. I have a great concentration and patience.

### Education

I have gained all my knowedge thanks to the program called IT-kariara powered by SoftUni.

- IT-kariera is a three year-long national program, consisting of 12 modules and one final matriculation exam.

- During education, I was taught the programming essentials, object-oriented programming, data bases, algorithms, embedded and operating systems, functional programming, internet programming and general software development.

- I mainly worked with .NET Framework Console Applications, ASP.NET Core Applications and MySQL but also TinkerCad (C++) and Haskell.

- The program was powered by the Technology School Electronic Systems (TUES), Software University (SoftUni) and the Ministry of Education.

- During a two week internship at the company Haemimont , I worked on a demo REST API about giving specific shape files with longitude, latitude and colors to a map and visualising it. I learned the main concepts of the database PostgreSQL and the platform QGIS, Postman, DBeaver. My main contributions were at the back-end side with the language C# and the technology ASP.Net.Core.

### Knowledge 

The best part about knowledge is that it can aways be extended!

I have great understanding of: 
 - Client-server side connections
 - Open ports
 - REST APIs 
 - Backend-Frontend integration
 - OOP (Object Oriented Programming) based programs
 - OOP (Object Oriented Programming) concepts 
 - Complex algorithms and data structures
 - I can build Asp.Net.Core applications with C#
 - SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL
 - MVC, MVVM, MVP architecture patterns
 - I can work with Razor Pages
 - SOLID Principles
 - HTTP requests, HTTP responses, TCP, UDP
 - Security, Authentication, Authorization
 - I have a little knolwadge of HTML and CSS

### Weakness 

My biggest weakness is frontend, since I have aways been working with backend technologies. 
I'm working on becoming better at the frontend part and my goal is to master HTML, CSS, JavaScript and use it not only for frontend (React.js), but
also for backend (Express.js, Node.js).
